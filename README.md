# 3ft_Under: Bury Newly Added Cards

## About:
This addon auto buries newly added cards (within n days) upon starting up Anki. Option in study menu for burying these cards manually. And the buried stats are synced to ankiweb for use with mobile devices. Anki resets buried stats everyday, so you need to run this addon once a day before syncing.
